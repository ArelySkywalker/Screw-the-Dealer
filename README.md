# Screw the Dealer mobile app

## Summary:
Everyone tries to screw the dealer in a bad way.

## Set Up:
Each player is dealt a card. The player with the lowest card (Aces high/2s low) is initially designated as the dealer. The dealer collects all the cards and shuffles.

### Language:
**(X)**: Drinks or whatever rules you would like to do. Drinking is not necessary to play the game.
**Take(s) n:** n is the amount of (X).

## Gameplay:
The dealer deals asks the first player on their left to guess the card value (2 through Ace) of the card on top of the deck. The dealer checks if they are right; if the first guess is correct then the dealer takes 4. If the first guess is wrong then the dealer tells the player whether the card is Higher or Lower than their guess.

The player then guesses again and the dealer places the card face up on the table. If the second guess is correct then the dealer takes 2. If the second guess is wrong then the player takes the number of (X) equal to the difference between their guess and the value of the card. For example the player's second guess is 10 and the card is revealed to be a King (which is equal to 13), the player must take 3.

Play continues this way in a clockwise fashion until the deck is exhausted. If three players in a row do not guess the card on top of the deck correctly on either guess then the player to the left of the dealer becomes the dealer.
